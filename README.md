# Forward kinematics and Interpolation methods

* *forward_kinematics.py* file shows the forward kinematic technique where the end-effector of an articulated arm reaches a goal.
* *interpolation_methods.py* file shows diffrent interpolation methods. Having certain points, it constructs new points creating a curve that passes through all of them.
